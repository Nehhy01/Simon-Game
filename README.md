# Simon Game 🟡🔵🔴🟢

A fun and interactive memory game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🎮 What is Simon?

Simon is a classic electronic memory game where the player repeats a growing sequence of colors and sounds. With each level, the game adds one more step to the sequence. The challenge is to remember and repeat the entire pattern — one mistake and it's game over!

## 🧠 How to Play

1. Click **Start** (or press any key) to begin the game.
2. Watch closely as one or more colored buttons flash and make a sound.
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the exact order.
4. If you succeed, the sequence gets longer by one color.
5. If you press the wrong button, the game ends and you can try again.
